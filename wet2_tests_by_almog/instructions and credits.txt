Tests were generated by Almog Tabo.

Tests contain two folders:
	- with_playerbounds - these tests will also check getPlayersBound
	- without_playerbounds - same tests excactly, but without getPlayersBound
	If you wanna test your getPlayersBound function, use with_playerbounds folder, otherwise (if you didn't implement it) use without_playerbounds folder.
	Please note the commands in the instruction part will use with_playerbounds folder, if you wanna use the other one, just change the command.

	
Instructions:
	redirect the input files (<) and output files (>)
	you may use the following bash (linux) command if you want: (replace <executable> with your executable name)
		run all 100 tests with get:
			for i  in {0..99}; do <executable> < with_playerbounds/input_$i.txt > my_output_$i.txt ; done
		to check for diffs in output, you can then use:
			for i  in {0..99}; do diff -s -q with_playerbounds/out_$i.txt my_output_$i.txt ; done
